An HTML page with javascript random dice and list-pickers.

Simply download the file to your computer.
Open the file by double-clicking the file name from your file explorer.
It will run as a local web page in your browser.
Use it when playing my play-by-post zombie adventure games on steemit or hive. Games can be found in @happyme's blogs.
Enjoy!
